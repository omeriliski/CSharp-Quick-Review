Migration commands
- add-migration
- update-database
- remove-migration // delete the last migration which is not applied to the database
- script-migration // generate a SQL script for the migration

if migration is applied to the database we can use update-database <migration name>, so we can apply a specific migration
Example:
update-database 20231010123456_InitialCreate
update-database 20231010123456_InitialCreate -context MyDbContext
update-database -context MyDbContext

now we want to go to the specific migration, so we can use the command: update-database -migration 20231010123456_InitialCreate
now we can delete the migration after migration 20231010123456_InitialCreate
